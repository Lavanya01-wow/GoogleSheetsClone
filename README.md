## Overview
This is a **Google Sheets Clone** built with simple web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). It allows you to create and manipulate a spreadsheet-like grid, apply basic formatting, perform mathematical operations, and handle data transformations (like trimming, case conversion, removing duplicates, and more).

## Tech Stack
1. **HTML**: Structures the webpage and sets up the spreadsheet table.
2. **CSS**: Styles the user interface, making the spreadsheet resemble a typical sheet/grid.
3. **Vanilla JavaScript**: Implements logic for creating, formatting, resizing rows/columns, applying formulas, and more.

**Why This Tech Stack?**
- **Simplicity**: Using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS keeps the project light, easy to understand, and straightforward to modify.
- **Browser Support**: Most modern browsers support these core technologies without additional tooling.
- **Learning & Demonstration**: It's an excellent project to demonstrate DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic data handling in JavaScript.

## Data Structures & Approach
- **DOM (Document Object Model)**:  
  - Instead of using a complex in-memory data structure (like a 2D array or custom classes), this project leverages the DOM itself. Each cell in the table is directly edited through the `contentEditable` property.  
  - The spreadsheet is essentially a `<table>` element where each `<tr>` represents a row and each `<td>` represents a cell.
  
- **Row and Column Headers**:  
  - The headers (A, B, C... for columns and 1, 2, 3... for rows) are generated by mapping character codes (for columns) and numbering rows.

- **In-Cell Data Storage**:  
  - Each cell's text is stored in its inner text (`cell.innerText`).  
  - When performing formulas or transformations, the necessary data is pulled from the DOM (the cell’s text) and processed.

- **Formula Parsing**:  
  - Simple string operations split the formula (e.g., `=SUM(A1:A3)`), identify the function (`SUM`, `AVERAGE`, etc.), and parse the cell range (`A1:A3`).  
  - A regex pattern (`/^([A-Z]+)(\d+):([A-Z]+)(\d+)$/`) extracts the start and end cells.

- **Event-Driven Updates**:
  - **Click events** are used to highlight or select an active cell.
  - **Drag-and-drop events** are used to move cell data from one place to another.
  - **Prompts** are used to request user input for text color, find-and-replace, and removing duplicates.

This approach keeps the logic transparent and the code more direct, without the overhead of maintaining a separate data model.

## Features
1. **Spreadsheet Grid**:
   - Dynamically creates an initial 10x10 grid.
   - Each cell is editable and can be resized by dragging column/row headers.

2. **Formula Bar**:
   - Supports basic mathematical functions: `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `COUNT`, `MEDIAN`, and `PRODUCT`.
   - Takes a formula like `=SUM(A1:A3)` and applies it to the active cell.

3. **Formatting Tools**:
   - **Bold** / **Italic** toggling.
   - **Change Text Color**.

4. **Row & Column Management**:
   - Add or delete rows and columns.

5. **Data Quality Tools**:
   - **Trim**: Removes leading and trailing spaces.
   - **Case Conversion**: Uppercase, Lowercase, Title Case.
   - **Reverse Text**: Reverses text in the selected cell.
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Removes duplicate rows in a given range.
   - **Find & Replace**: Searches and replaces text in a specified range.

6. **Drag-and-Drop**:
   - Move data between cells by dragging and dropping.

## Usage
1. **Download or Clone** the repository.
2. **Open** the `index.html` file in your favorite browser.  
   - Make sure `style.css` and `script.js` are located in the same directory (or adjust paths if needed).
3. An initial 10x10 spreadsheet table will appear.
4. **Begin Editing**:
   - Click a cell to select it.  
   - Use the top toolbar to apply formatting or add/delete rows and columns.  
   - Type formulas in the formula bar (`=SUM(A1:A3)`) and click **Apply Formula**.
   - Explore data quality features like **Find & Replace**, **Remove Duplicates**, etc.

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**:  
   - `createSpreadsheet(10, 10)` generates a 10x10 grid with row and column headers.
   - Adds event listeners for clicking cells, editing text, and drag-and-drop functionality.

2. **Applying Formulas**:  
   - The formula is read from the input field.  
   - A regular expression identifies the function and cell range.  
   - The cell values are retrieved from the DOM, converted to numbers, and the result is written back to the selected cell.

3. **Formatting**:  
   - When you click **Bold** or **Italic**, the script toggles the CSS style properties (`fontWeight`, `fontStyle`) of the active cell.

4. **Row/Column Resizing**:  
   - A small `div` (handle) is appended to each header cell that, when dragged, adjusts the width or height of that column/row.

5. **Data Quality Utilities**:  
   - **Trim**: Simple string `.trim()` on the active cell’s text.  
   - **Case Conversions**: `.toUpperCase()`, `.toLowerCase()`, or custom logic for Title Case.  
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Uses a `Set` to track row data in a given range; duplicates are removed by deleting the corresponding table row.  
   - **Find & Replace**: Searches within the specified range and uses `.replace()` to swap text.
